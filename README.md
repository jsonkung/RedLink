# RedLink
RedLink is a Google Chrome extension that creates redirect links that the user can use to navigate to URLs with more ease.

## Usage example

A user can access the RedLink interface by typing `rl + <space>` or `rl + <tab>` in the Google Chrome address bar to open the omnibox.

A binding can be created by entering `add <keyword> <url>` into the omnibox.

This binding can then be used by entering the `keyword` into the omnibox after setting it.

All bindings can be cleared by entering `clear` into the omnibox.
